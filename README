Abstract
--------
ii is a minimalistic FIFO and file system based IRC client. Upon connection, it
creates an IRC directory prefix which contains the server directory (its name
can be overridden by directory). Beyond the path, inside the server directory,
there are channel and nickname directories together with a FIFO file named "ii"
and a regular one called "out". These two latter files do also occur inside
each channel and nickname directory, which themselves are created upon joining
a channel or opening of a private conversation.

The FIFO files "in" are used to communicate with the server, while the regular
"out" files carry the server messages. If the data sent to an "in" file is not
an IRC command, in other words not starting with a slash "/", it will be
interpreted as a regular message (PRIVMSG) which later pops up in the "out"
file in the same directory level.

The idea of this file system structure, is to be able to communicate with an
IRC server using basic command line tools. For example, if the desired action
is to join a channel, the command echo /j #channel > in will do the trick no
matter which "in" FIFO file it is addressed to, as long as the file is in use
by the current instance of ii.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup. ii and wrapper are installed into
/usr/local by default.

Afterwards, enter the following command to build and install ii and
wrapper (if necessary, as root):

    $ make clean install

Running ii
------------
Simply invoke the 'ii' command with the arguments of your choice. For
information about the available arguments, consult the manpage or pass ii the
option "-h".

To make ii a bit more comfortable, use it in combination with the multitail
program and for example with vim. Run vim in the server directory and use
key mappings like:
map w1 :.w >> \#ii/in<cr>
map w2 :.w >> \#wmii/in<cr>
to post to channels.

If you use the next editor line for a new posting, you can use ctrl-p for nick
completion if you have written the nick in the past.
Thanks to Matthias Kopfermann for this hint.

Configuration
-------------
No configuration is needed.

Changelog
---------

please have a look at the commit messages on http://code.suckless.org/hg/ii/
they are fairly descriptive on releases prior to 1.2.
