Abstract
--------
ii(1) is a minimalistic FIFO and filesystem based IRC client. It creates an IRC
directory tree with server, channel and nickname directories. In every
directory a FIFO file (in) and a normal file (out) is created. This will be, for
example, in irc/irc.freenode.net/.

The in files are used to communicate with the servers and the out files include
the server messages. For every channel and every nickname, there will be a new
in and out file. The idea of this is to be able to communicate with an IRC
server using basic command line tools. Take an example: if you want to join a
channel, just `echo "/j #channel" > in` and ii(1) will create a new channel
directory with an in and out file inside it.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup. ii(1) is installed into /usr/local by
default.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install ii(1) and
wrapper(1) (if necessary as root):

    $ make clean install

Running ii
------------
Simply invoke the 'ii' command with required arguments

To make ii a bit more comfortable use it in combination with the multitail
program and for example with vim. Run vim in the server directory and use
key mapping like:
map w1 :.w >> \#ii/in<cr>
map w2 :.w >> \#wmii/in<cr>
to post to channels.

If you use the next editor line for a new posting you can use ctrl-p for nick
completion if you wrote the nick in the past.
Thanks to Matthias Kopfermann for this hint.

No configuration is needed.

Changelog
---------
Since I missed the chance to add a proper changelog right from the beginning,
please have a look at the commit messages on http://code.suckless.org/hg/ii/
they are fairly descriptive on releases prior to 1.2.
