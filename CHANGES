1.6 (2011-01-31):
    - Fix regression introduced for handling unknown commands.

1.5 (2011-01-24):
    - Fix channel name comparison in add_channel(), compare lowercase
      to prevent leaking file descriptors in the long run => Thanks samurai!
    - Only handle commands ii(1) explicitly understands and treat the rest as
      raw IRC (only worked for raw commands in capital letters in the past) =>
      Thanks samurai!
    - Create "in" FIFO, on receiving a PRIVMSG, directly instead of requiring a
      new "/j" command first => Thanks Evan Gates.
      This also implies that "in" FIFOs aren't deleted on channel leaves any
      longer, because this itself creates a channel event again which in turn
      would recreate the file.
    - Minor changes.

1.4 (2008-08-09):
    - Fix directory traversal on servers that support SAJOIN. NOTE: not marking
      it as security relevant as it is only possible to create directories
      outside (which is of course annoying) of the IRC hierarchy but not
      overwriting arbitrary files with the channel name.
    - Documentation fixes.
    - General cleanup.

1.3 (2007-07-14):
    - Server messages about users (QUIT,JOIN) will no longer go to the user
      directories but to the server out file to give an easy method to monitor
      it and to prevent spamming of the IRC directory.

1.2 (2007-06-23):
    - Exit on channel creation failure, thanks Michael Prokop.
    - Implemented joining of password protected channels.
    - Removed the "-v" option from the manpage as it's not implemented.
