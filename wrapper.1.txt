WRAPPER(1)		   OpenBSD Reference Manual		    WRAPPER(1)

NAME
     wrapper - wraps ii(1) and allows execution on connect

SYNOPSIS
     wrapper [-i ii arg] [-s sh arg] -- host1 port1 [host2 port2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The wrapper utility randomly selects one pair of hosts and ports before
     it passes the pair as arguments to ii(1) using system(3).	Additional
     arguments can be given to ii(1) by specifying them in ii arg.  In case
     ii(1) exits, this procedure is done all over again.

     If sh arg is given, wrapper forks and then initializes ii(1).  The child
     process sleeps for 300 seconds (default) before passing sh arg to
     system(3).	 This is useful in order to, for example, authenticate with
     NickServ or rejoin IRC channels after a disconnection.

SEE ALSO
     ii(1), sh(1), fork(3), sleep(3), system(3)

HISTORY
     The development of wrapper began in the early 2011's with the first
     version released on January 9, 2011 via http://repo.or.cz/w/iii.git.

CAVEATS
     Notice that sh(1) meta-characters must be escaped in both ii arg and sh
     arg and that the -s and -p flags of ii(1) have no effect in ii arg.

     To prevent ii(1) from choosing different server directories as
     connections are made to various hosts, pass it the -d flag.  The argument
     of the flag will override this part of the file path.

     As wrapper changes the working directory to "/", all file paths must be
     given relative to that directory.
