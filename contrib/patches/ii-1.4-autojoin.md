AUTOJOIN
========

*This patch is now applied to the upstream version of ii(1).*

Description
-----------
When a user messages you or you are made to join a channel (as with bitlbee),
ii(1) will automatically join so there is no need to either `echo /j channel >
in` or `echo /j user message > in` before you can start sending messages.
