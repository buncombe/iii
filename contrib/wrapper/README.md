Wrapper - wraps ii(1) and allows execution on connect
=====================================================

Description
-----------
The wrapper(1) utility was mainly written in order to get reconnection
abilities on networks that do not use round robin DNS. Its manpage
([txt][mantxt] or [html][manhtml]) explains more in details how it works.

To build and install it, invoke the commands bellow:

	cd iii/contrib/wrapper
	make install
