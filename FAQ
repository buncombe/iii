FAQ
===

1. Where is IRC command xy (ignore etc.)?
--------------------------------------
ii is for advanced users, please use standard tools like awk, sed and grep for
this. This can be done easily and will not bloat the code.

2. Where is a graphical interface?
-------------------------------
Basically ii follows the UNIX philosophy, which means that it is only file
based. But it should be easy to build different interfaces because they only
have to handle the FIFOs and output files. Feel free to implement or wait until
we have done this (some people have actually done it now, just check the
internet). Personally I use ii in combination with vim, multitail and screen
and it works like a charm.

3. Which commands are supported?
-----------------------------
j (join or msg), t (topic), a (away), n (nick), l (leave). The missing ones are
obsolete or can be easily used by typing the IRC commands itself (i.e. /WHO
instead of /who).

4. How can I recognize queries?
----------------------------
ii itself doesn't support this but the queries.sh script is an example of how
to get the new and changed files in your irc directory. To get an instant
notice of a new file, other mechanisms like inotify/dnotify could be used as
well but I was too lazy to try it out since the script is enough for me.

5. What other fancy stuff can I do with ii?
----------------------------------------
It is very easy to write irc bots in ii:
tail -f \#/out | while read foo; do name=echo $foo | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's,<\\(.*\\)>,\\1,'; if 0 -eq expr $RANDOM % 10 then echo "$name: WHAT??" ; fi; done
This will just spam a channel but think about using nagios2irc or you can
use ii to generate channel stats. Your imagination should be boundless.

6. How can I automatically reconnect to a server or network?
---------------------------------------------------------
As you might have guessed, ii does not support this feature. The fact is
however that it easily can be done by scripting or with the wrapper(1) program
that is shipped with this package of ii.
